# Worthless Hello World

**Worthless Hello World** is a project with a very simple goal:
**display "hello world" on the screen — but using the worst code possible.**

No readability.
No optimization.
No common sense.

Only **intellectual overengineering**, **algorithmic bad faith**, and **far too much abstraction** for something that should’ve fit into a single line:

```java
System.out.println("hello world");
```

## 🎯 Objective

| What we *want* to do | What we’re *willing* to do to make it happen                                                                         |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Print text           | Useless loops, Base64 encoding, binary parsing, multithreading, temporary I/O, Java reflection, and other atrocities |

## 🧪 Project Philosophy

> *“Why make it simple when you can make it painfully unbearable?”*

## ✅ Contribution Rules

* Every new way to display **`hello world`** must be **more absurd than the previous one**.
* If your code is **readable**, **understandable**, or **logical**, **your PR will be rejected automatically**.
* If you’re proud of your code, you didn’t get the point.
